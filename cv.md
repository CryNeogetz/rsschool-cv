## Briefly About Myself:
> My goal at the moment is to become a middle developer as soon as possible and find a job. I started my immersion in programming with the layout of websites. I've been studying python for the last six months and writing small projects on it. I want to become a full stack developer, so now I've started studying the frontend. __My strengths are:__ 
> - constant learning of something new 
> - responsibility 
> - desire to be useful.
